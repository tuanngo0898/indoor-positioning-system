While doing this thesis, I have received a great deal of support and assistance. I would like to express my very great appreciation to all my lecturers, especially Dr. Vo Que Son, in the Department of Telecommunications, Faculty of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Ho Chi Minh University of Technology. Thanks to their enthusiastic instruction.

I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my parents for giving me continuous encouragement through the process of researching and writing this thesis. Their love helps me to overcome the difficulties to achieve accomplishments in my life. This thesis would not have been possible without them.
