\chapter{Introduction to TDMA}

Time-division multiple access (TDMA) is a channel access method for shared-medium networks. In TDMA technique, each contender is assigned with a dedicated slot for its own use. Thus, TDMA is contention-free. 

RTLS use TDMA channel access. The nodes operate using repeating "superframe" structure of duration 100ms.
