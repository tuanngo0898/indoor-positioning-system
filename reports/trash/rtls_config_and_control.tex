\subsection{Criteria for anchor sign-up}
Before an anchor can join an existing network, the following criteria must be satisfied:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The cluster map and cluster neighbor map (sent as part of Beacon messages) must indicate there is a free seat to occupy. (i.e. the number of occupied BCN slots in the superframe is $<$ 16)
    \item Clock level of the in-range anchors is lower than 127. The anchors which can hear initiatorâ€™s beacons are at clock level 1. The next ones are clock level 2, etc.
    \item All in-range anchors have confirmed that the requested seat (requested by the anchor wishing to join) is free and no collisions with the other devices occurred during the sign-up process.
    \item The firmware must be compatible (if FW update is enabled), i.e. the version must match the version in the initiator. The firmware version is sent in the Almanac messages.
\end{itemize}
