\chapter{Summary}

\section{Accomplishment}
This thesis has accomplished two main task:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Design and implement an indoor localization system using UWB
    \item Build a system to manage and control the localization system based on Bluetooth mesh network.
\end{itemize}

\section{Further development}
Follows are some plans for a future work.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Improve the system stability: More experiments must be done to find sensitive issues hided in the system.
    \item Test and deploy network with more node: The current system has been tested with 8 anchors, however, an industrial system may need much more anchor.
    \item Optimize system for longer battery life: In the current system, with a 600mAh back up battery form China, an anchor can last for approximately 8.0 hours. Better battery life may be necessary.
\end{itemize}
